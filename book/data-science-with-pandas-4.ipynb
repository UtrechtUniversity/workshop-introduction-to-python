    "Visualizing data means representing information in a graphical or visual form. This form does not provide additional information to what we already have in the data, but it usually allows a more intuitive understanding and interpretation of the data. Whether you are doing research ot not, being able to properly visualize data is an essential tool for data analysis, exploration, and communication. Data visualization is also fundamental to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that might not be immediately obvious from raw data."

    "<a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\">Matplotlib</a> is one of the most popular and widely-used data visualization libraries for Python programming language. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and many more. As its name suggests, Matplotlib was initially developed to emulate MATLAB (a non-open source programming language) graphics commands, but it is totally independent of MATLAB and, as you will learn, it is designed to fully interface with python objects.

This can make navigating through its features quite confusing, especially for absolute beginners. However, the matplotlib module `pyplot` provides a simpler interface for creating plots and graphs, still allowing to generate a wide range of visualizations with just a few lines of code. In this session we will plot \"fake\" data and data contained in our pandas DataFrames using pyplot. We will go through the main matplotlib concepts and we will generate several kinds of plots to illustrate matplotlib and pyplot potential."

    "Let's start reading some data and plotting it. Keep in mind that in python everything is an object and that each object has attributes and methods. Attributes can be simple values, strings, arrays, or any other python data strucutre. They are accessed with a dot and the name of the attribute: `object.attribute_name`. Methods, on the other hand, are functions associated with an object. Methods are used to perform some action on the object or to return a value based on the object characteristics. Methods are ran with a dot, the name of the method, and all the necessary methods parameters inside parenthesis: `object.method_name()`. Why do attributes and methods matter for plotting our data? Because pandas DataFrames integrate many matplotlib functionalities in their methods like, for example, ```plot()```. The method documentation can be found <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html\">here</a>, on the page you will find all the available parameters to customize your plot.
