    "As we mentioned in the introduction, matplotlib library is huge and you can customize every single little feature of your plot. With matplotlib you can also create animations and 3D plots. Now that you know the basics of plotting data, have a look at the <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/gallery.html\">matplotlib gallery</a> to check out the huge variety of plots you can generate with matplotlib and try to reproduce those plots yourself."

    "Ok, Matplotlib is great, but is there anything else out there for data visualization? Yes, there is, [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)! Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib and inspired by `ggplot` (R users will know this). It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn syntax is almost identical to Matplotlib, checkout seaborn gallery [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html)."
