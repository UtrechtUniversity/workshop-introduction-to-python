    "By using `ax.scatter` 2 times inside the for loop, the two sets of points end up in the same **Axes**, one on top of the other following the order in which they are plotted. Colors are assigned automatically, but you can also create a list of colors and use one of them at each iteration of the loop. Specifying `alpha=0.5`, we can make the plotted dots semi-transparent, this attribute is particularly useful when overplotting data (like in this case). When plotting multiple grouped dataset on the same _Axes_ it is fundamental to label them and show a legend explaining color conventions. This is automatically done specifying a label when data is plotted and by calling the `legend()` method on the _Axes_ object after the data is plotted."

Matplotlib will automatically recognize the format of the output file from its name. If you will specify only a name without extention, you can indicate the format explicitly with the parameter *format*. We also need to specify the dpi (dots per inch), i.e. the quality of the picture. The quality of the picture depends on the media we want to use. 200 dpi is good enough for visualization on a screen."
