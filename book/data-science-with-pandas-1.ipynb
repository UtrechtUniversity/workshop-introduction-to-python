    "While tasks like finding a relevant research question and interpreting data are challenges for the critical and analytical skills of the single researcher, all the tasks related to data manipulation, from data reduction and statistical analysis to modelling and visualization, require a systematic use of a quite large variety of software. No need to say that implementing such software yourself from scratch would require a huge amount of time, without even mentioning all the issues related to software mantainance. Luckily for us, people have already devoloped software with specific tools for data analysis. These tools are organised into *packages* or *libraries*, they usually are openly available (according to the programming language you use), and they keep to be mantained and developed by a huge community of users. In particular, for python programmers, the most popular data analysis library is Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python library <a url=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/about/\">**Pandas**</a> is a popular open-source data analysis and data manupulation library for Python that started to be developed in 2008. The library is based on two main data structures: *Series* (1D, similar to numpy arrays) and *DataFrame* (2D labeled arrays). Why shall we use Series and DataFrame when we can work with numpy arrays and matrices? Because Pandas has been designed specifically for data manipulation and analysis tasks, providing tools and functions for data cleaning, data transformation, data aggregation, and data visualization, among other data-related tasks. Adopting Pandas, we can run through all the main technical tasks in our data analysis pipeline mainly using a single python library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is widely used in data science, machine learning, and data analysis tasks, as it provides powerful tools for data handling and manipulation, making it easier to work with a large variety of data. Furthermore, it well integrates with other Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical analysis, such as NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and StatsModels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Pandas is a powerful and flexible library for data analysis and manipulation in Python, widely used in various domains including data science, finance, business, and research."

We can convert our data into DataFrame using Pandas functions, they can read a quite large variety of formats like the *comma-separated values* (CSV) file format. In CSV files data values are separated by a comma (\",\"), but files where values are separated by a semicolon (\";\"), space (\" \") or tab (\"\\t\") can also have a .csv extention.
