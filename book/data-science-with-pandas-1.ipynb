    "## Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of Python (and many programming languages) is in the libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A library (aka package) is a collection of files (aka python scripts) that contains **functions** that can be used to perform specific tasks. A library may also contain data. The functions in a library are typically related and used for a specific purpose, e.g. there are libraries for plotting, handling audio data and machine learning and many many more. Some libraries are built into python, but most packages need to be installed before you can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important to add: libraries are developed and maintained by other Python users. A popular library like Pandas has a large user base and the maintainers are supported by several funders, which makes it a reliable library that is updated very frequently. But this is not always the case, on the other side of the spectrum, a library can also be published once and not maintained at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas\n",
    "The python library [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/) is a popular open-source data analysis and data manipulation library for Python which was developed in 2008. The library has some similarities with R, mainly related to the DataFrame data type that is used to handle table like datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is widely used in data analyses and machine learning, as it provides powerful tools for data handling and manipulation. Furthermore, it integrates well with other Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical analysis, such as NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and StatsModels. \n"
