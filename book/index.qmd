# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

Python is a powerful programming language that is suitable for scientific computing and general-purpose programming. Python is used to write scripts to work efficiently and reproducibly with scientific data. 

In this workshop, we will utilize the Jupyter Notebook interface and take you from the basics of Python syntax to using the `pandas` package to work with data frames. In doing so, we aim to give you the tools and confidence to start exploring Python and all it has to offer.
