## Overview

The course materials are designed to be run on a personal computer.
All of the software and data used are freely available online,
and instructions on how to obtain them are provided below.

If you have any questions, or are not comfortable with doing the installation yourself
join the [RDM walk-in hours][walk-in-hours] to ask for help.

## Install Python

In this course, we will be using Python 3 with some of its most popular scientific libraries.
[Python][python] is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose
programming as well.
Although one can install a plain-vanilla Python and all required libraries by hand,
we recommend installing [Anaconda][anaconda-website],
a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the lesson. 
Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [Anaconda documentation][anaconda-install],
or by following the instructions below.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, **please make sure you install Python version 3.x**
(e.g., 3.9 is fine).

We will teach Python using the [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter], a programming environment that runs 
in a web browser (Jupyter Notebook will be installed by Anaconda). For this to work you will need
a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers
are all [supported][jupyter-compatibility] (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer
version 9 and below, are not).

## Windows
1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda for Windows installer with Python 3. (If you are not sure which version to choose, you probably want the 64-bit Graphical Installer `Anaconda3-...-Windows-x86_64.exe`)
3. Install Python 3 by running the Anaconda Installer, using all of the defaults for installation *except* make sure to check **Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable**.

## MacOS 
1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda Installer with Python 3 for macOS (you can either use the Graphical or the Command Line Installer).
3. Install Python 3 by running the Anaconda Installer using all of the defaults for installation.

## Linux
1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda Installer with Python 3 for Linux. <br>
   (The installation requires using the shell. If you aren't
   comfortable doing the installation yourself
   stop here and come to the [walk-in hours][walk-in-hours] to ask for help.)
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the executable is downloaded (e.g., `cd ~/Downloads`).
4. Type 
   ```{sh}
   bash Anaconda3-
   ```
   and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to autocomplete the full file name. The name of file you just downloaded should appear.
5. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Return</kbd> depending on your keyboard).
   You will follow the text-only prompts.
   To move through the text, press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>.
   Type `yes` and press enter to approve the license.
   Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Return</kbd>)
   to approve the default location for the files.
   Type `yes` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Return</kbd>)
   to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH`
  (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
6. Close the terminal window.

## Obtain lesson materials

1. Download [??-data.zip][zipfile-data]
        and [??-code.zip][zipfile-code] (see [Course Materials][course-materials]).
2. Create a folder called `intro-python` on your Desktop.
3. Move downloaded files to `intro-python`.
4. Unzip the files.

You should see two folders called `data` and `code` in the `intro-python` directory on your
Desktop.

## Launch Python interface

To start working with Python, we need to launch a program that will interpret and execute our
Python commands. Below we list several options. If you don't have a preference, proceed with the
top option in the list that is available on your machine. Otherwise, you may use any interface
you like.

## Option A: Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based interface for working with Python.
If you installed Anaconda, you can launch a notebook in two ways:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Command line (Terminal)
1. Navigate to the `data` directory:<br>
	**Unix shell**<br>
	If you're using a Unix shell application, such as Terminal app in macOS, Console or Terminal
	in Linux, or [Git Bash][gitbash] on Windows, execute the following command:
	```{bash}
	cd ~/Desktop/intro-python/data
	```

	**Command Prompt (Windows)**<br>
	On Windows, you can use its native Command Prompt program.  The easiest way to start it up is
	pressing <kbd>Windows Logo Key</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, entering `cmd`, and hitting
	<kbd>Return</kbd>. In the Command Prompt, use the following command to navigate to
	the `data` folder:
	```{sh}
	cd /D %userprofile%\Desktop\intro-python\data
	```
2. Start Jupyter server:<br>
	**Unix shell**
	```{bash}
	jupyter notebook
	```

	**Command Prompt (Windows)**
	```{sh}
	python -m notebook
	```
3. Launch the notebook by clicking on the "New" button on the right and selecting "Python 3"
	from the drop-down menu.

## Anaconda Navigator
1. Launch Anaconda Navigator.
It might ask you if you'd like to send anonymized usage information to Anaconda developers.
Make your choice and click "Ok, and don't show again" button.
2. Find the "Notebook" tab and click on the "Launch" button.
Anaconda will open a new browser window or tab with a Notebook Dashboard showing you the
contents of your Home (or User) folder.
3. Navigate to the `data` directory by clicking on the directory names leading to it.
`Desktop`, `intro-python`, then `data`:
4. Launch the notebook by clicking on the "New" button and then selecting "Python 3".

## Option B: IPython interpreter

IPython is an alternative solution situated somewhere in between the plain-vanilla Python
interpreter and Jupyter Notebook. It provides an interactive command-line based interpreter with
various convenience features and commands. You should have IPython on your system if you installed
[Anaconda][anaconda-website].

To start using IPython, execute:
```{bash}
ipython
```

## Option C: plain-vanilla Python interpreter

To launch a plain-vanilla Python interpreter, execute:
```{bash}
python
```

If you are using [Git Bash on Windows][gitbash], you have to call Python _via_ `winpty`:
```{bash}
winpty python
```
